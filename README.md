### Hello! I am Eugene Vetrov, a front-end developer. 👋

In life, I am most interested in science and communication with people. Web development attracts me precisely because it is a science-intensive and social activity.
In Front-end development, I like the fact that it is a part of an application that people interact with directly.
Programming is my passion. It is an activity that helps me feel satisfaction from what I do.

## Мой стек:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- React
- Angular
- Vue.js
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- MySQL
- Java
- Spring

Я - доброжелателен и в целом люблю общаться, особенно по делу.
